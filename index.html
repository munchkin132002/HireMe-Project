    <p> Since I absolutely love sports, I see myself in the NFL 10 years from now. I am determined to train myself so that I can make it into the NFL within the next 10 years. I aspire to be as good as my favorite player Odell Beckham Jr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odell_Beckham_Jr.">Wikipedia</a></p>
